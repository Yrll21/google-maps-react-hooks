# Contributing to Ubilabs Google Maps React Hooks

We are happy you came here and thank you for contributing! ðŸŽ‰ 

To get started there are some things that need to be set up.

----

## Setting Up Dev Environment

We will work on the `develop` branch. 


We use [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) to manage the dependencies.

### Fork the repo and start building

All new features and bug-fixes should be branched off and merged into the `develop` branch.

#### Follow these steps to get started:

1. Fork the repo (click the <kbd>Fork</kbd> button at the top right of [Google Maps React Hooks](https://github.com/ubilabs/google-maps-react-hooks)).

2. Clone your fork locally

```bash
# In a terminal, cd to parent directory where you want your clone to be, then
git clone https://github.com/<your_github_username>/google-maps-react-hooks.git

# cd to the google-maps-react-hooks directory
cd google-maps-react-hooks

# Checkout the develop branch
git checkout develop
```

3. At the root directory of the project on the develop branch, install all dependencies and build.
```bash
# Install dependencies 
npm install

# Start the project locally before changing code
npm run start:library
```

4. Create a new branch where to make code changes.

```bash
# Make sure you are on the develop branch
git checkout develop

# Create a new branch
git checkout -b feat/my-new-feature-branch
```

5. To see example cases of the Google Maps react hooks, checkout the [Examples Folder](./examples). To start an example:
```bash
# If not done already: Go to 'google-maps-react-hooks' directory and run:
npm install

# Run an example (look at the different examples for their start scripts):
npm run start:sample-map
```

Then open [`localhost:1234`](http://localhost:1234) in a browser.

- please provide test cases for all features and bug fixes

- provide documentation for all public API methods

- commit messages should follow the format outlined in [CONVENTIONS.md](CONVENTIONS.md)

### Code Style and Code Quality

- Testing

   - [ESLint](https://eslint.org/) configuration files are provided

## Adding An Example
Each hook should have an example in the examples folder. If you want to provide an example for a hook, please follow these steps:

1. Create a new folder in the [examples folder](./examples) with the name of the hook file.

2. In the folder, create a runnable React App showing the usage of the new hook in a common use case. Checkout the current examples in the [examples folder](./examples) to see how the setup should looks like. The [basic google map example](./examples/basic-google-map/) is always a good starting point.

3. Add a npm task in the [examples workspace package.json](./examples/package.json) with a naming convention like this:
```json
"start:example-folder-name": "EXAMPLE_ENTRY=./example-folder-name/index.html npm run start:example"
```
Please compare to the other example start tasks.

4. Add another npm task in the root [package.json](./package.json) to start the example, with a naming convention like this:
```json
"start:example-folder-name-example": "EXAMPLE=example-folder-name run-p start:library start:example"
````
Please compare to the other example start tasks. 

5. Add a README to each example with an explanation of what the example does, a code snippet and an image of the example app in a ratio of 2:1.
