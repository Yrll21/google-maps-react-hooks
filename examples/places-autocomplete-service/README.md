This is an example setup of a **Places Autocomplete Service** to show the usage of the **useAutocompleteService hook** with the Google Maps React Hooks library.

once to install all dependencies.

Then start this example locally with

```shell
npm run start:places-autocomplete-service-example

**NOTE**:
To see the examples it is needed to add an `.env` file with a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Maps%20Platform%20%3E%20Credentials%20page.&text=On%20the%20Credentials%20page%2C%20click,Click%20Close.) in the following format:

```
GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<YOUR API KEY HERE>"
```

An example can be found in `.env.example`.
