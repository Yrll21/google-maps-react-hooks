# Basic Google Maps Setup Example

This is an example setup to show a **Google Map with markers** with the Google Maps React Hooks library.

## Instructions

To run this project, clone the Google Maps React Hooks repository locally.

At the root of the repository, run:

```shell
npm run start:map-with-markers
```

**NOTE**:
To see the examples it is needed to add an `.env` file with a [Google Maps API key](https://developers.google.com/maps/documentation/embed/get-api-key#:~:text=Go%20to%20the%20Google%20Maps%20Platform%20%3E%20Credentials%20page.&text=On%20the%20Credentials%20page%2C%20click,Click%20Close.) in the following format:

`GOOGLE_MAPS_API_KEY="<YOUR API KEY HERE>"`

An example can be found in `.env.example`.
